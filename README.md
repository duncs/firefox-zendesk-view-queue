# Firefox Extension - Zendesk View Queue

A Firefox extension to report the count and list of tickets in the configured Zendesk View.

This extension uses the Zendesk API to fetch details of tickets from a View. This allows the user to easily see if there are any tickets requiring action without having to log into the Zendesk UI.

This extension is most useful for those Zendesk users that occasionally need to review and act on tickets, rather than those permanently logged in and reviewing the UI
