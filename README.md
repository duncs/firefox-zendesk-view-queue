# Firefox Extension - Zendesk View Queue

A Firefox extension to report the count of and list the tickets in the configured Zendesk View.

The extension uses the Zendesk API to fetch details of tickets in the configured view. This allows the user to easily see if there are any Zendesk tickets requiring action without having to log into the Zendesk UI.

This extension is most useful for those Zendesk users that do not perform the majority of their function in Zendesk, but do occasionally need to review and act on tickets.
